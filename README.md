# AI-based traffic monitoring system using YOLO and OpenCV

AI-based traffic monitoring system utilizing YOLO and OpenCV has been developed.
This system aims to address the challenges posed by the ever-increasing vehicular
population and the consequent traffic congestion.By employing the YOLOv3 algorithm,
known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection, alongside the
image processing capabilities of OpenCV,the system can effectively track, identify, and
classify vehicles.The integration of convolutional neural networks and other machine
learning techniques has significantly improved the precision of vehicle detection and
classification, facilitating real-time analysis of extensive data.The deployment of this
technology promises to enhance driving safety, optimize traffic flow, and pave the way
for autonomous driving advancements highlights the trans formative potential of this
era.The system is designed to monitor traffic in detail, providing valuable insights for
traffic management, safety analysis, and urban planning.
